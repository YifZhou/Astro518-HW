\section{Introduction}
Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) is the near infrared imaging instrument equipped
on Spitzer Space Telescope. NIRCam is the imaging camera on James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST). I listed the general design and performance
comparison of these two instrument to illustrate the big leap of
NIRCam comparing to IRAC.

Although exoplanet observation is not the key factor in defining
the IRAC desgin \citep{2004ApJS..154...10F}, astronomers made great progress in detecting and
characterizing exoplanet with the help of IRAC. I listed several key
discoveries in exoplanet with IRAC to demonstrate what aspect of IRAC
is made use of in exoplanet studies. With the comparison of optical
performance, we can see the potential of NIRCam in exoplanet
observations. 
%\section{Scientific Requirements}

\section{Instrumentation Design}
\subsection{Optical Design}

The optical design of Spitzer IRAC and JWST NIRCam are demonstrated in
figure \ref{fig:optics}.\par

\subsubsection{IRAC}
The optics path of IRAC is relatively simple comparing to that of
NIRCam. Two pickoff mirrors that are slightly displaced and tilted
separate the light into two beams. Each reflected beam then passes
doublet lenses to be reimaged at the focal plane. After the doublet
lenses, two Ge substrate beam splitters separate the lower beam into
Channel 1 (reflected) and Channel 3 (transmitted) and the upper beam
into Channel 2 (reflected) and Channel 4 (transmitted). Finally 4
Channels of light are received by 4 detectors accordingly. This design
enables IRAC to take image in 4 different bands simultaneously.\par

\subsubsection{NIRCam}
NIRCam consists of two modules, each imaging a $2.16' \times 2.16'$
field of view.  The modules are built on two optical benches mounted
back-to-back. As a result, the two fields of views imaged by the
modules are adjacent.  The modules are functionally identical, with
identical optical and focal plane components. They are mirror images
of each other except for coronagraphic pupil masks.

The optical design of each module is shown in figure
\ref{fig:optics}. There are more devices on the optics path of NIRCam to enable
different observation mode. After reflection of pickoff mirror and
first fold mirror, the light are then split by a dichroic
beam-splitter into long wave beam and short wave beam. Before the two
beams reach the detector, two filter wheels are equipped on the paths
so that multi-band imaging can be accomplished. After the pick-off
mirror, there is a coronagraph elements to provide NIRCam the ability
to make coronagraphic measurements.

Several optical elements are added or specially designed for optical
accuracy improvement. The pickoff mirror is actuated by a three
degree-of- freedom focus and alignment mechanism that provides fine
positioning in tip, tilt, and piston, allowing NIRCam to accommodate
small pointing and focus changes that may manifest themselves once the
observatory is on-orbit \citep{2005SPIE.5904...30H}. Internal
calibration sources including a flat field source and a coranographic
source are used to aid with on-orbit calibration and characterization.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Focal Plane Array}

\subsubsection{IRAC}
IRAC has 4 detector arrays to recieve photons in 4 channels. The 4
arrays are all 256$\times$256 pixels in size and have the same
physical pixel size of 30 $\mu$m. The channel 1 and channel 2 arrays
are made of InSb while the longer wavelength channels 3 and 4 are
Si:As detectors\citep{2004ApJS..154...10F}.


\subsubsection{NIRCam}

NIRCam is based on 2048$\times$2048 HgCdTe photodiode chips, with
physical pixel size of 18 $\mu$m $\times$ 18 $\mu$m pixels
\citep{2005SPIE.5904...21B}. The chips used for the short and long
wavelength channels are based on different types of HgCdTe. However,
in what concerns their functionality and control they are basically
identical.  The sensitive area of a chip is 2040x2040 pixels, due to a
4 pixel wide border of reference pixels along all edges. Reference
pixels are used for tracking bias drifts during an exposure.  The
finer pixel scale of the short-wavelength channels requires a Focal
Plane Array, i.e. a 2x2 mosaic of chips butted with a small gap (5‚Äù)
between them \citep{2005SPIE.5904...21B}. The resulting gaps in the
images have to be filled by dithering moves of the telescope. The long
wavelength channels use a single chip.  The fields observed by the two
modules are adjacent with about 50" separation. Also this larger gap
in the images has to be filled by dithering moves.


\subsection{Operation Mode}
\subsubsection{IRAC}

The four 256$\times$256 Focal Plane Arrays can be read out with different
operation mode.They are full-array readout mode, stellar photometry
mode and subarray mode.\par

In full-array readout mode, there were four selectable frame times: 2,
12, 30, and 100 s \citep{2004ApJS..154...10F}. To allow sensitive observations without losing dynamic
range, there was a high dynamic range (HDR) option. 

Stellar photometry mode was available for observations of objects much
brighter in channels 1 and 2 than in 3 and 4 (typically stars). This
mode took short exposures in channels 1 and 2, and long exposures in
channels 3 and 4.  The sensitivities of each frame are identical to
those in full array mode.

For very bright sources, a subarray mode was available. In this mode,
only a small $32 \times 32$ pixel portion of the array was read out,
so the field of view was only $38' \times 38'$. Mapping was not
allowed in subarray mode.  In subarray readout mode, there were three
selectable frame times: 0.02, 0.1, and 0.4 sec. This mode allows
observer to catch fast variability of the targets.


\subsubsection{NIRCam}
Comparing to IRAC, NIRCam equipped with much more complicated devices,
which allows different observation to be made with.

The primary purpose of the NIRCam instrument is to take image
measurement. For imaging observation, the major difference from IRAC
is that both short wave and long wave channels of NIRCam are furnished
with a Filter Wheel that allows for observations through more than 12
different spectral bands. There are totally 30 filters on NIRCam,
whose wavelength covers from 0.7 to 4.8 $\mu$m. 

Another unique feature of NIRCam is the ability to make Coronagraphic
measurements. In coronagraphic mode, a coronagraphic occulting mask
that can be chosen from a selection of $\mathrm{sinc}^{2}$, top-hat, and Gaussian
designs, optimized for light at either 2.0 or 4.6 $\mu m$ block the
light from the bright sources. This mode is essential in high contrast
imaging observation, e.g. direct imaging of exoplanets.

NIRCam is also available for spectroscopic observation. NIRCam has a
grism in the long wavelength channel. The grism offers the capability to
carry out slitless spectroscopy in the wavelength range 2.4 to 5 $\mu$m,
with spectroscopic resolution R $\sim 2000$.


\section{Instrument Performance}
\label{sec:performance}
As a detector equipped on the next generation infrared space
telescope, NIRCam definitely surpasses IRAC in different ways. Here I
compare several key factors that most valued by exoplanet observation
between IRAC and NIRCam to illustrate the great potential of NIRCam of
expanding our horizon on exoplanet. There factors are spatial
resolution, spectral coverage, sensitivity, and frame
rate.\par

\subsection{Spatial Resolution}
High spatial resolution is essential in direct imaging
observation. Limited by small primary mirror size of Spitzer Space
Telescope (0.85 m), it is not IRAC's strength to spatially resolved
objects. The FWHM of point spread function (PSF) is $1''.66, 1''.72,
1''.88 \mbox{and} 1''.92$ at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 $\mu$m channels,
which is hugh for direct imaiging study. The large pixel scale
($~1''.2$) resulting in under sampled PSF makes the situation even
worse. As a result, IRAC is hardly ever used for imaging of wide
orbit planetary mass companions.\par

The 6.5 m sized primary mirror of JWST provide NIRCam with significant
spatial resolve ability. NIRCam's PSF has FWHM of $0''.063$, and is
nearly 20 times sharper than that of IRAC. The pixel scale that is
optimized at 2 $\mu$m ensured well sampled PSFs at that wavelength. At
smaller wavelength, the PSF would be a little undersampled. However
the sample rate is still better than IRAC.

\subsection{Wavelength Coverage}
IRAC covers four wavelength channel at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 $\mu$m. The
wavelength coverage of NIRCam which ranges from 1 to 5 $\mu$m lacks
long wave length ability comparing to IRAC. However, more than 30
filters supplied with NIRCam would provide spectral energy
distribution with fine structures.

\subsection{Sensitivity}

Low thermal emission of exoplanets call for high sensitivity. Table
\ref{tab:irac-sen} and figure \ref{fig:nircam-sen} illustrate the
sensitivities of IRAC and NIRCam. In figure \ref{fig:nircam-sen},
sensitivities are expressed as the flux required to get 10 $\sigma$ signal
with a 10000 s exposure. Since $\sigma sim \sqrt{t}$, 10 $\sigma$
signal with 10000s exposure is generally equivalent to  1 $\sigma$
signal with 100s exposure. Comparing to IRAC, NIRCam is more than 30
times sensible with wide band filter and more than 10 times sensible
with narrow band filter.\par

  \caption{NIRCam Sensitivity (10 $\sigma$, exopsure time 10000s,
    nJy)}
  \label{fig:nircam-sen}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Frame Rate}
To catch the fast variability of target, the detector is required to
be read out fast. IRAC has an outstanding  performance for high frame
rate thanks to its subarray mode. It can be read out a $32 \times 32$
subarray for as fast as 0.02 s.

NIRCam also has the ability to read  part of the full array out at a
speed of 10 $\mu$s per pixel. Therefore to read the same size subarray
as IRAC, it takes about 0.01 s, which is even shorter than what it
takes for IRAC.

There are other factors related to exoplanet observation. For
instance, high dynamic range that prevent the bright primary star
image from severe saturation is essential in high contrast direct
imaging observation. This point is not discussed here because IRAC is
not suitable for such observation and NIRCam has coronagraphic element
to overcome these problems, which makes it not comparable.

To sum, NIRCam has much better performance than IRAC in the aspects discussed
above.

\section{Application in Exoplanet}
\subsection{IRAC's Contribution in Exoplanet Observation}
Initially, the most important in defining the IRAC design was the
study of the early universe (\citep{2004ApJS..154...10F}). However, with the
advantage in infrared wavelength coverage and high sensitivity, IRAC
plays a great role in exoplanet observation. Although IRAC is limited
by its design, e.g. the large FWHM of PSF is an obstacle for IRAC to
carry out direct imaging of exoplanet, IRAC is the best devices for
infrared transiting photometry before the launch of JWST. \par

Exoplanets' low surface temperatures locate their thermal emission
peaks in infrared. Specially hot Jupiters whose effective
temperatures are about 1000 K, are most ideal targets to detect
thermal emission with. \citep{2005ApJ...626..523C} took advantage of IRAC's
high photometry precision to first detect the secondary eclipse of
exoplanet TrES-1 which confirmed the thermal emission coming from the
planet. They observed the target two channels, (4.5 and 8.0 $\mu$m),
observed the field, and obtained 1518 full-array images in each of the
two bandpasses \citep{2005ApJ...626..523C}. The great accuracy of spitzer
photometry data made it possible for them to construct the light curve
presented in figure \ref{fig:irac-lc} and detect the secondary eclipse
dip.\par

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \plotone{second_eclipse}
  \caption{Light curve of TrES observed by IRAC Channel 4 (8$\mu$m)
    \citep{2005ApJ...626..523C}.}
  \label{fig:irac-lc}
\end{figure}

In subarray mode, the high read out speed of IRAC is utilized to
monitor the temporal variability of exoplanet. \citet{2007Natur.447..183K}
observed HD189733 that is an eclipse planetary system containing a hot
Jupiter and constructed a ‚Äômap‚Äô of the distribution of temperatures by
modeling the variability of the light curve. They monitored HD 189733
continuously over a 33.1 hour period using the 8 $\mu$m channel of
IRAC in subarray mode with a cadence of 0.4 s. With the high cadence,
high precision time series data (\ref{fig:iraf-lc2}), they saw a
distinct rise in flux beginning shortly after the end of the transit
and continuing until a time just prior to the beginning of the
secondary eclipse, from which they created the map of exoplanet
temperatures.\par

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \plotone{irac-lc2}
  \caption{Light curve of high cadence observation of HD189733
    system\citep{2007Natur.447..183K}. }
  \label{fig:iraf-lc2}
\end{figure}

The combination of 4 channel photometries of IRAC could open a window
for the study of exoplanet atmosphere \citep{2014PNAS..11112601B}. By comparing
multi-band eclipse/secondary eclipse photometry with model spectrum,
water and dust cloud feature can be traced \citep{2010ApJ...710.1551O}.

\subsection{NIRCam's Potential}
\S \ref{sec:performance} illustrates the great advantage in exoplanet
observation. With the extraordinary work done with IRAC, we have
reasons to expect NIRCam to make huge difference in this area of
study.

\subsection{Direct Imaging}
Being different from IRAC that could only detect the thermal emission
from exoplanet indirectly from secondary eclipse, NIRCam is able to
directly take the image of exoplanets. The 6.5 m sized primary mirror
and coronagraphic devices help NIRCam overcome two obstacles of direct
imaging observation, small separation the planet from its host star
and the high contrast in flux. With these barriers, today's ground
based or HST direct imaging targets are always on the boundary of
planet and binary companions, whose masses are $\sim 10 M_{\mbox{Jul}}$
  and separations are more than 50 AU. However, a simulation for near
  by M star systems showed that NIRCam have the ability to detect
  Saturn-mass planet at ages of 1 Gyr or less located at a few 10s of
  AU from their host star \citep{2012SPIE.8442E..2NB}.

  \subsection{Transit Planet Study}
  NIRCam has significant strength in sensitivity over IRAC. Higher
  signal to noise data liberate observation from the limit in the size
  and distance of the planets. NIRCam will be sensitive enough to
  confirm many of the small exoplanet candidate found by the Kepler
  mission to be in the habitable zones of their host stars
  \citep{2012SPIE.8442E..2NB}. More fine structure would be uncovered
  in the transit light curve taken by NIRCam, allowing us to study
  properties such as limb darkening, oblateness and occultations of
  the transit planets more precisely.

Similar to IRAC, high frame rate in subarray read out mode let NIRCam
catch fast variability of transit planets with much higher signal to
noise. Great quality of data improves the confidence in mapping the
surface temperature as well as clouds or hazes structures of the
planets.

\subsection{Exoplanet Spectroscopy}
The most prominent advantage of NIRCam over IRAC is its
multi-wavelength ability. The 4 channel IRAC observation is too coarse
to identify any spectroscopic feature. However, more than 30 filters
of NIRCam as well as the grism would totally reverse the situation.

For directed imaged planets, NIRCam allows grism observation to obtain
the near infrared spectra of planetary mass companions to near by
brown dwarfs \citep{2005SPIE.5905..185G}. Multi-band photometry and spectra
would reveal information on accretion and formation history of
exoplanets, which give the answer to the question that how planets
form. NIRCam grism observation could also study the jets from young T
Tauri stars, which would disclose  the sizes, excitations and column
densities of such jets within $~10$ AU of nearby T Tauri stars,
probing the radiation environments and gas densities of their
planet-forming regions \citep{2005SPIE.5905..185G}.\par

Spectroscopic observation of transit planets is a powerful tool for
planet atmosphere study. Figure \ref{fig:spec} presents a simulation
of exoplanet's atmosphere observed by JWST NIRSpec. NIRCam grism could
provide low resolution spectra partially covering that region, which
would act together with NIRSpec's high resolution spectra to help
identify atmosphere components of exoplanets.
\begin{figure}[h]

  \plotone{NIRSpec}
  \caption{JWST NIRSpec prism simulation covers the wavelength range
    of NIRCam grism \citep{2013ApJ...775...80F}. The low resolution NIRCam
    grism spectra would be very useful for identifying water, methane
    and haze components.}
  \label{fig:spec}
\end{figure}

\section{Summary}
As the imaging device equipped on JWST, NIRcam exhibit its
extraordinary power in spatial resolution, sensitivity, spectroscopic
ability and read-out speed. NIRCam has significant advantages over
IRAC in these aspects, which guarantees its great potential in
exoplanet observations.

Frankly speaking, it is not for IRAC whose initial aim is to carry out
deep, large-area surveys of $z>3$ galaxy, to compare the ability of
exoplanet observation ability with NIRCam who is optimized for exoplanet
studies. However, since even an unoptimized instrument would make great
discoveries, we should be reasonably confident about the future
observations with NIRCam.
